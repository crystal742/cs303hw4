This assignment had multiple different coding questions. 
This file contains all of the answers to each question. 

Question 1:
Write a recursive function to_number that forms the
integer sum of all digit characters in a string. For example, the result
of to_number("3ac4") would be 7. 

Question 2:
Write a recursive linear search function with a recursive
step that finds the last occurrence of a target in a vector, not the first. You will need to
modify the linear search function (You can find it in the slides) so that the last element of
the vector is always tested, not the first.

Question 3:

Programmatically generate three type o Programming: f arrays (or vectors)
of size 10,000: an array that is sorted in ascending order, a reversed array (an array that
is sorted in descending order), and a random array.
â€¢ Programmatically sort the three arrays using bubble sort, selection sort, insertion
sort, shell sort, merge sort, and quick sort (the regular one and the improved one
) algorithms. For each sorting algorithm, calculate the number of exchanges (or
shifts) and the number of comparisons for these sorting algorithms

Question 4: 
Modify the source code for the inserti Programming: on sort so that it can
sort a list of integers (You can find the source code on Blackboard and the slides). Is there
a difference in performance (compared to the vector-based one)?
